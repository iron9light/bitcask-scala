A scala port of Basho's Bitcask - local key/value store (http://bitbucket.org/basho/bitcask)

The Bitcask is soooooooo simple(http://downloads.basho.com/papers/bitcask-intro.pdf), that I think I can write my own.

There are some different between Bitcask and bitcask-scala.
bitcask-scala set the valueSize to 0xFFFFFFFF as this record has been removed.
But Bitcask use <<"bitcask_tombstone">> as removed value.

I use RandomAccessFile, it will flush every writing.

And I do not implement lock, merge and fold.

I run it on my Intel Core Dou E6550, Mint 8 (32bit) PC. FASTER than Bitcask:)
